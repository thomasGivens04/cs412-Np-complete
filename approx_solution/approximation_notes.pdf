1. Explain strategy (greedy, anytime, etc.).
- I used a greedy randomized approach to solve the max clique problem.
I start with a randomly selected vertex and attempt to grow the clique by
adding a random vertex that is connected to all the other vertices already
in the clique. If there are multiple vertices that are available to be added
to the clique I randomly select one and continue from there. When the max
clique is found it is stored and then I repeat the greedy process about
300 times to find the largest max clique. Since we repeat the process
multiple times it is an anytime style algorithm that will get a better
answer the more times we repeat the greedy process.

2. Discuss the analytical runtime analysis of your
approximation. Recall it must run in polynomial time.
- I have two main methods for my approach, the first one is reading the graph.
Reading the graph processes each edge and puts them in an adjacency list, the
time required for this is O(e) e being the number of edges, so the runtime for
reading the graph is constant. The second method is my greedy approach, the
worst case runtime of my greedy approach is O(n^3) because it has a loop
with a set comparison. So the total runtime of my approach is O(e) + O(n^3)
which simplifies to just O(n^3).

3. Program performs “reasonably well” on test cases on Gradescope
- My code passed all the gradescope tests.

4. run_test_cases.sh showscases at least 3 test cases (1 with nonoptimal results)
- My run_test_cases.sh file has 3 test cases and 1 nonoptimal test case.
