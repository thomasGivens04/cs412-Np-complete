README -- Instructions for the Approximate solution for Part C of the Max Clique Problem


-------------------
Input Specification
-------------------
The input for the max clique problem will be an undirected graph.

The first line will list the number of edges m. The remaining m lines are a list of vertice pairs.

Sample Max Clique input:
2
a b
b c

This is a graph with three vertices, a, b, and c and two edges {a, b} and {b, c}.

Sample output:
a b
